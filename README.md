# millet-record

Lightweight capture-only subset of [millet](https://github.com/pretyflaco/millet)
(formerly meetscribe-record).

Records dual-channel meeting audio — your microphone on the left
channel, system/remote audio on the right — into a single stereo WAV
via PipeWire or PulseAudio + ffmpeg. Ships none of millet's
transcription, diarization, summarization, or PDF dependencies;
install footprint is ~30 MB instead of ~3 GB.

Full release history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).  Named after
the Ottoman *millet system*.  Part of the
[vezir](https://github.com/pretyflaco/vezir) ecosystem.

## When to use which

| Need | Install |
|---|---|
| Just record audio (e.g., for [vezir](https://github.com/pretyflaco/vezir) thin clients, or local archival) | `pip install millet-record` |
| Record + transcribe + diarize + summarize + PDF | `pip install millet-pipeline` (depends on millet-record) |

## Install

```bash
pip install millet-record
```

System deps (apt example):

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg pulseaudio-utils
```

## CLI

```bash
millet check                   # verify prerequisites
millet devices                 # list audio sources
millet record                  # record dual-channel WAV; Ctrl+C to stop
millet archive                 # compress past WAV recordings to OGG/Opus
millet request-permissions     # macOS Sequoia 15+: trigger Microphone /
                               # System Audio Recording TCC prompts
                               # (Apple removed the manual '+' button in
                               # System Settings, so apps must request)
```

`millet record` writes to `~/millet-recordings/meeting-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/...wav`
unless `-o` is passed. See `millet record --help` for options.

When `millet-pipeline` is also installed, additional subcommands
(`transcribe`, `run`, `label`, `sync`, `gui`, ...) become available
under the same `millet` command via Click entry-points.

### Legacy `meet` command

The pre-rename `meet` console script keeps working for two minor
versions (until `millet-record 0.6.0`).  It prints a deprecation
warning on each invocation and forwards to the `millet` group.  Set
`MILLET_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATION=1` to silence the warning during
transition.

## Architecture

`millet-record` exposes a stable package `millet_record` containing:

- `millet_record.capture` — ffmpeg-backed dual-channel capture
  (RecordingSession, watchdog, drain buffer)
- `millet_record.audio` — stereo channel reading + ffmpeg-based audio
  compression
- `millet_record.utils` — formatting helpers (HH:MM:SS, file sizes)
- `millet_record.languages` — language constants used by capture flow
- `millet_record.cli` — `millet` console-script entry point

The legacy `meet_record` package name is still importable via a
`sys.modules` alias + a meta-path finder, so existing
`from meet_record.X import …` keeps working unchanged.  Removed in
`millet-record 0.6.0`.

`millet-pipeline` depends on this package and re-uses these modules,
plus its own heavy modules (transcribe, label, voiceprint, summarize,
sync, pdf, gui).

## macOS (Apple Silicon)

`pip install millet-record` on macOS 14.4+ Apple Silicon ships a
bundled `meet-record-mac` Swift sidecar that captures via Core Audio
Process Tap + AVAudioEngine — no PulseAudio, no BlackHole, no extra
install.  `millet record` uses it by default.

> **Note:** the Swift binary itself is still named `meet-record-mac`
> for now — renaming would require macOS code-signing bundle-path
> changes that aren't worth doing as part of the package rename.
> Tracked as a follow-up; doesn't affect end users.

First run prompts for Microphone and System Audio Recording permissions
via the standard macOS TCC dialogs; both are required for full dual-
channel capture (mic on left, system on right). See
[`mac/README.md`](mac/README.md) for the sidecar's CLI surface, level
analysis recipes, and environment variables.

On **macOS Sequoia 15+**, Apple removed the manual `+` button from
System Settings → Privacy → Microphone, so users can no longer add
permissions before running the app.  The `millet request-permissions`
subcommand explicitly calls `AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess(for: .audio)`
to trigger the TCC dialog.  `millet check` will tell you which
permission is missing and suggest running `request-permissions`.

Set `MEET_RECORD_MAC=0` to force the legacy ffmpeg+PulseAudio path
(diagnostic kill switch only — that path will fail on a stock macOS
install because there is no PulseAudio device).  Intel Macs and
macOS < 14.4 are unsupported.
